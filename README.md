# PDF Text Summarizer

## Project Description
This project uses machine learning techniques to summarize text extracted from PDF documents. The project leverages attention mechanisms and Generative AI techniques for text summarization. The models and methods are outlined in the provided Jupyter notebooks.

## Files in the Project:
1. **pdf_text_summarizer_attention.ipynb**: Implements text summarization using attention mechanisms.
2. **pdf_text_summarizer_gen_ai_v1.ipynb**: Contains the first version of text summarization using generative AI models.
3. **pdf_text_summarizer_gen_ai_v2.ipynb**: Updated version of generative AI-based text summarization with improvements.
